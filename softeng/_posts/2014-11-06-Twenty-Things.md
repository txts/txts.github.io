What is true about SE that is true _now_ and was true _20 years
ago_ and may be true in _20 years time_? To make this an
interesing question, let us demand that the answers are
refutable; i.e. that there is some evidence for each answer
and that if you proved the evidence wrong, then
we would have to recant the answer.

A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects. However, one study indicated that the majority, over 80%, of the maintenance effort is used for non-corrective actions.[2] This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system. More recent studies put the bug-fixing proportion closer to 21%.[3]
