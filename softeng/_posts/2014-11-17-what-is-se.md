## Definiton


SE is the 

+ _process_ of the
+ _design_,
+ _construction_ and
+ _maintenance_ of
+ _good  enough_
+ _software_,
+ given the _available resources_.

The last point means that we are always trading off between
what we want with
what we need with what we've got. _Software engineers_, therefore
are the people we look to:

+ Make and
+ justify
+ well-informed decision about
+ trade-offs in software engineering.

This, in turn means that in any circumstance, software engineering are
aware of _multiple possibilities_ and the _reasons_ why we should be doing
one, and not the others. To do this they must:

+ _ Strategy 0 GOTO SCHOOL!_ Build up their background knowledge about SE;
+ _Strategy 1: READ!_ Using the literature, extend that knowledge by _reading widely_ and making
  some adjudication about all that material.  
+ _Strategy 2: MINE!_: Using data science, collect and analyze project data;
+ _Strategy 3: EXPLORE!_: Using software construction tools, consider multiple designs (perhaps via some prototyping.

## About Design

Humans not perfect designers:

+ Will Rogers: _It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so._
+ Wikipedia, long, long list of cognitive biases. e.g.
  [inattentional blindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo)
  from [Simons and Chabris](http://goo.gl/bgHzrn)

Bad Design has economic consequences:

+ Barry Boehm: [Software Engineering Economics](http://goo.gl/Mcnb5l).
  Cost of coping and working around
  earlier bad design decisions grows dramatically, the longer
  those decisions remain in the design.

But some design, working towards better design, is infinitely
better than no design:

+ George Box: _All models are wrong, but some are useful_.
Imperfect designs are needed to get to good designs:

+ Donald Schon: reflective design,  "activity by which (people)
  take work itself as an object  of reflection". That is do a design
  then take a second, third, fourth look at it.
+ [Vilfredo Pareto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto):
  _Give me the fruitful error any time, full of
  seeds, bursting with its own corrections. You can
  keep your sterile truth for yourself."_w
+ Donald Norman:
  [The Design of Everyday Things](http://goo.gl/iFWt4).
  _It takes N designs to get it right, most projects
   canceled after one bad design.)
