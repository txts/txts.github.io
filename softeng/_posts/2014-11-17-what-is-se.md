## Definiton


SE is the 

+ _process_ of the
+ _design_,
+ _construction_ and
+ _maintenance_ of
+ _good  enough_
+ _software_,
+ given the _available resources_.

The last point means that we are always trading off between
what we want with
what we need with what we've got. _Software engineers_, therefore
are the people we look to:

+ Make and
+ justify
+ well-informed decision about
+ trade-offs in software engineering.

This, in turn means that in any circumstance, software engineering are
aware of _multiple possibilities_ and the _reasons_ why we should be doing
one, and not the others. To do this they must:

+ _ Strategy 0_: build up their background knowledge about SE;
+ _Strategy 1_: using the literature, extend that knowledge by _reading widely_ and making
  some adjudication about all that material.  
+ _Strategy 2_: using data science, collect and analyze project data;
+ _Strategy 3_: using software construction tools, consider multiple designs (perhaps via some prototyping.
