In the before time, olde worlde models were 
laboriously 
translated by hand into code, then forgotten (or, at least, never maintained).
Those were illusionary,
write once, read rarely, run never.

21st century models are more intelligent. They are reflective, and automatically argue back with you to point out
the stuff you forgot to write down, or that you wrote down wrong.
