What is true about SE that is true _now_ and was true _20 years
ago_ and may be true in _20 years time_? To make this an
interesing question, let us demand that the answers are
refutable; i.e. that there is some evidence for each answer
and that if you proved the evidence wrong, then
we would have to recant the answer.
