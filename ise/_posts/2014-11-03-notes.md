+ _Acqusition_: Methods to exlicit models (ways to trick models out of people, systems)
+ _Characterize_: Methods to characterize the models (collect size statistics)
+ _Clone_ : Methods to build representative examples (build _fakes_)
+ _Doubt_ :Ways to handle uncertainity (in model inputs, in internal model structure)
+ _Execute_: Methods to run the models (shoiuld see a range of ouputs)
+ _Objectives_ : Methods to score the outputs
